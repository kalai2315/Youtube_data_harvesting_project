**YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing


Overview**
		This project focuses on gathering data from YouTube, utilizing Python scripting for data collection, and storing the obtained data in MongoDB and SQL databases. It further involves the creation of a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the collected data. Key components of the project include API integration, data management using MongoDB Atlas and SQL, and efficient data retrieval and exploration through the Streamlit interface.

**Features**
**1. Data Collection**
	Python scripts are employed to interact with the YouTube API, fetching relevant data such as video metadata, comments, and engagement metrics.

**2. Storage**
	The collected data is stored in both MongoDB and SQL databases. MongoDB provides flexibility for storing unstructured data, while SQL databases ensure relational integrity and support complex querying.

**3. Streamlit Dashboard**
	The project includes a Streamlit web application for visualizing and exploring the harvested YouTube data. Users can interact with the data through an intuitive interface, facilitating data-driven insights and decision-making.

**4. API Integration**
	The project integrates with the YouTube API to access a wide range of data available on the platform. This includes video details, channel statistics, comments, and more.

**5. Data Management**
	MongoDB Atlas is utilized for cloud-based storage and management of MongoDB databases, offering scalability and reliability. Additionally, SQL databases are employed for structured data storage and efficient querying.

**Technologies Used**

**Python**: Programming language used for scripting, data manipulation, and web application development.

**MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing unstructured data retrieved from YouTube.

**SQL**: Relational database management system used for structured data storage and querying.

**Streamlit**: Python library for creating interactive web applications for data visualization and exploration.

**YouTube API**: Provides access to various data endpoints on the YouTube platform.
